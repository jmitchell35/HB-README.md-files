# Simple intial usage for the source code

## Purpose

The very simple purpose of this project is to save some precious time by quickly building readable and well-organized REAMDE.md files for Holberton School's projects. As some of us, as beginner developpers, might not have a lot to show for, this allows keeping a decent GitHub for recruiters who might want to give a look at our curriculum. It converts one project's  HTML page to a refined markdown page.

## Usage
From browser, inspect project page.
Copy the element \<div class = "project row container-max">
The quizz must be completed so that all tasks appear properly.
Save the HTML code to the file of your choice.
The source code was initially used very simply on VS Code, both edited and run from there.
Just be careful to the file path used to retrieve the html code.
Also, you may need to install some additionnal features to run the code.
* Python debugger for VS Code
* bs4 package for python (install using pip if running on Windows, or sudo apt install python3-bs4 if running WSL or Linux distro)
